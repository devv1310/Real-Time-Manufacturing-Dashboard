Development Proposal: Real-Time Manufacturing Status Dashboard
1. Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement a real-time dashboard that provides live insights into manufacturing processes, tracks key performance indicators (KPIs), and sends smart alerts whenever anomalies, delays, or breakdowns occur.

This will empower decision-makers, plant operators, and managers to quickly react to issues, reduce downtime, and optimize operations.

2. Key Features

Real-Time Data Ingestion

Collect live data from manufacturing machines, IoT sensors, ERP/MES systems, or APIs.

Stream processing via tools like MQTT, Kafka, or WebSockets.

Dashboard Visualization

Interactive dashboard with live KPIs (OEE, production counts, downtime, cycle times, defects).

Charts: line graphs, bar charts, heatmaps, and machine status indicators (running, idle, error).

Plant-floor view with machine-specific status indicators.

Smart Alerts & Notifications

Trigger alerts on machine breakdowns, threshold breaches, or anomalies.

Notification channels: Email, SMS, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or push notifications.

Configurable alert rules.

Historical Data & Trends

Store and analyze historical data for reporting and predictive insights.

Compare performance across shifts, machines, and timeframes.

User Access & Roles

Role-based authentication (operators, supervisors, managers).

Customizable dashboard views depending on user role.

3. Technology Stack (Proposed)

Frontend (Dashboard UI): React.js + D3.js/Recharts/Chart.js

Backend (Data Processing): Django or FastAPI (for APIs & logic)

Real-Time Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ, or MQTT

Database:

PostgreSQL (for structured data & reporting)

InfluxDB/TimescaleDB (for time-series sensor data)

Alerts & Notifications: Twilio / SendGrid / Slack API

Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes (scalability), hosted on AWS/Azure/GCP

4. Development Phases
Phase 1: Requirement Gathering & System Design

Identify exact KPIs, machine data sources, and integration points.

Define alert rules and user roles.

Design system architecture (data pipeline + dashboard).

Phase 2: Data Integration & Real-Time Pipeline

Connect to data sources (IoT sensors, MES/ERP, machine PLCs).

Implement data ingestion and stream processing pipeline.

Phase 3: Dashboard UI Development

Build real-time dashboard with charts and machine indicators.

Develop role-based access and customizable layouts.

Phase 4: Smart Alerts & Notifications

Implement anomaly detection and alert triggers.

Configure alert delivery (SMS, Email, Slack).

Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

Conduct unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.

Deploy dashboard to cloud infrastructure with monitoring.

Phase 6: Maintenance & Enhancements

Regular updates based on feedback.

Add predictive maintenance and AI-based insights (future scope).

5. Deliverables

Fully functional real-time dashboard

Smart alerting system

Documentation (system architecture, user guide)

Training sessions for client team

6. Timeline (Estimate)

Phase 1: 1–2 weeks

Phase 2: 2–3 weeks

Phase 3: 3–4 weeks

Phase 4: 2 weeks

Phase 5: 1–2 weeks

Total Estimated Time: 9–13 weeks

7. Benefits for Client
